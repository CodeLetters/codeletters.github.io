      <h2>The Power of TypeScript: Enhancing JavaScript Development</h2>
      <h3>What is TypeScript?</h3>
      <p>
        TypeScript is a programming language developed by Microsoft. It extends
        JavaScript by adding optional static typing, which allows developers to
        catch errors during the development process. TypeScript is a superset of
        JavaScript, meaning that any valid JavaScript code is also valid
        TypeScript code.
